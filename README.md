  # SVG-Logo-Maker

  ## Description
  Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. All companies need a logo. This logo generator is flexible and easy to use while supporting three shape types and hexadecimal colors. I learned about SVG files, inheritance, promises, and test driven development.
